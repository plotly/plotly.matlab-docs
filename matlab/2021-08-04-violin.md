## Create Swarm Chart

Create a vector of `x` coordinates, and use the `randn` function to generate normally distributed random values for `y`. Then create a swarm chart of `x` and `y`.

```{matlab}
x = [ones(1,500) 2*ones(1,500) 3*ones(1,500)];
y1 = 2 * randn(1,500);
y2 = 3 * randn(1,500) + 5;
y3 = 5 * randn(1,500) + 5;
y = [y1 y2 y3];
swarmchart(x,y)

```

## Plot Multiple Data Sets with Custom Marker Size

Create three sets of `x` and `y` coordinates. Use the `randn` function to generate random values for `y`.

```{matlab}
x1 = ones(1,500);
x2 = 2 * ones(1,500);
x3 = 3 * ones(1,500);
y1 = 2 * randn(1,500);
y2 = [randn(1,250) randn(1,250) + 4];
y3 = 5 * randn(1,500) + 5;
```

Create a swarm chart of the first data set, and specify a uniform marker size of `5`. Then call `hold on` to plot the second and third data sets together with the first data set. Call `hold off` to release the hold state of the axes.

```{matlab}
x1 = ones(1,500);
x2 = 2 * ones(1,500);
x3 = 3 * ones(1,500);
y1 = 2 * randn(1,500);
y2 = [randn(1,250) randn(1,250) + 4];
y3 = 5 * randn(1,500) + 5;

swarmchart(x1,y1,5)
hold on
swarmchart(x2,y2,5)
swarmchart(x3,y3,5)
hold off

## Specify Marker Type

Read the `BicycleCounts.csv` data set into a timetable called `tbl`. This data set contains bicycle traffic data over a period of time. Display the first five rows of `tbl`. 

```{matlab}
tbl = readtable(fullfile(matlabroot,'examples','matlab','data','BicycleCounts.csv'));
tbl(1:5,:)
```


Create a vector `x` with the day name from each observation, and another vector y with the bicycle traffic observed. Then create a swarm chart of `x` and `y`, and specify the point marker `('.')`. The chart shows the distribution of bicycle traffic according to the day of the week.

```{matlab}
tbl = readtable(fullfile(matlabroot,'examples','matlab','data','BicycleCounts.csv'));

daynames = ["Sunday" "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" "Thursday" "Friday" "Saturday"];
x = categorical(tbl.Day,daynames);
y = tbl.Total;
swarmchart(x,y,'.');

fig2plotly(gcf)
```

## Display Filled Markers with Varied Color

Read the `BicycleCounts.csv` data set into a timetable called `tbl`. Create a vector `x` with the day name for each observation, another vector `y` with the bicycle traffic observed, and a third vector `c` with the hour of the day. 

Then create a swarm chart of `x` and `y`, and specify the marker size as `20`. Specify the colors of the markers as vector `c`. The values in the vector index into the figure's colormap. Thus, the colors change according to the hour for each data point. Use the `'filled'` option to fill the markers with color instead of displaying them as hollow circles. 

```{matlab}
tbl = readtable(fullfile(matlabroot,'examples','matlab','data','BicycleCounts.csv'));
daynames = ["Sunday" "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" "Thursday" "Friday" "Saturday"];
x = categorical(tbl.Day,daynames);
y = tbl.Total;
c = hour(tbl.Timestamp);
swarmchart(x,y,20,c,'filled');

fig2plotly(gcf)
```

## Change Jitter Type and Jitter Width

Read the `BicycleCounts.csv` data set into a timetable called `tbl`. Create a vector `x` with the day name for each observation, another vector `y` with the bicycle traffic observed, and a third vector `c` with the hour of the day. Then create a swarm chart of `x` and `y`, and specify the marker size as `5`, and the colors of the markers as vector `c`. Call the `swarmchart` function with the return argument `s`, so that you can modify the chart after creating it. 

```{matlab}
tbl = readtable(fullfile(matlabroot,'examples','matlab','data','BicycleCounts.csv'));
daynames = ["Sunday" "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" "Thursday" "Friday" "Saturday"];
x = categorical(tbl.Day,daynames);
y = tbl.Total;
c = hour(tbl.Timestamp);
s = swarmchart(x,y,5,c);

fig2plotly(gcf)
```

Change the shapes of the clusters at each `x` location, so that the points are uniformly and randomly distributed and the spacing is limited to no more than `0.5` data units.

```{matlab}
tbl = readtable(fullfile(matlabroot,'examples','matlab','data','BicycleCounts.csv'));
daynames = ["Sunday" "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" "Thursday" "Friday" "Saturday"];
x = categorical(tbl.Day,daynames);
y = tbl.Total;
c = hour(tbl.Timestamp);
s = swarmchart(x,y,5,c);

s.XJitter = 'rand';
s.XJitterWidth = 0.5;

fig2plotly(gcf)
```

## Specify Filled Markers with Transparency

Create a pair of `x` and `y` coordinates. Use the `randn` function to generate random values for `y`. Then create a swarm chart with filled markers that are 50% transparent both on their faces and on their edges.

```{matlab}
x1 = ones(1,500);
x2 = 2 * ones(1,500);
x = [x1 x2];
y1 = 2 * randn(1,500);
y2 = [randn(1,250) randn(1,250) + 4];
y = [y1 y2];
swarmchart(x,y,'filled','MarkerFaceAlpha',0.5,'MarkerEdgeAlpha',0.5)

```

## Specify the Target Axes

Read the `BicycleCounts.csv` data set into a timetable called `tbl`. This data set contains bicycle traffic data over a period of time. Display the first five rows of `tbl`. 

```{matlab}
tbl = readtable(fullfile(matlabroot,'examples','matlab','data','BicycleCounts.csv'));
tbl(1:5,:)
```



Define `x` as a categorical array of the day names in the table. Define `yEast` and `yWest` as vectors containing the eastbound and westbound bicycle traffic counts.

```{matlab}
tbl = readtable(fullfile(matlabroot,'examples','matlab','data','BicycleCounts.csv'));

daynames = ["Sunday" "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" "Thursday" "Friday" "Saturday"];
x = categorical(tbl.Day,daynames);
yEast = tbl.Eastbound;
yWest = tbl.Westbound;
```

Create a tiled chart layout in the `'flow'` tile arrangement, so that the axes fill the available space in the layout. Call the `nexttile` function to create an axes object and return it as `ax1`. Then create a swarm chart of the eastbound data by passing `ax1` to the `swarmchart` function.

```{matlab}
tbl = readtable(fullfile(matlabroot,'examples','matlab','data','BicycleCounts.csv'));

daynames = ["Sunday" "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" "Thursday" "Friday" "Saturday"];
x = categorical(tbl.Day,daynames);
yEast = tbl.Eastbound;
yWest = tbl.Westbound;

tiledlayout('flow')
ax1 = nexttile;
y = tbl.Eastbound;
swarmchart(ax1,x,y,'.');

fig2plotly(gcf)
```

Repeat the process to create a second axes object and a swarm chart for the westbound traffic.

```{matlab}(fullfile(matlabroot,'examples','matlab','data','BicycleCounts.csv'));

daynames = ["Sunday" "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" "Thursday" "Friday" "Saturday"];
x = categorical(tbl.Day,daynames);
yEast = tbl.Eastbound;
yWest = tbl.Westbound;

tiledlayout('flow')
ax1 = nexttile;
y = tbl.Eastbound;
swarmchart(ax1,x,y,'.');

ax2 = nexttile;
y = tbl.Westbound;
s = swarmchart(ax2,x,y,'.');

fig2plotly(gcf)
```
